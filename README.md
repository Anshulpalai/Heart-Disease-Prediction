# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The proposed work predicts heart disease by exploring the classification algorithms and doing performance analysis. The objective of this study is to effectively predict if the patient suffers from heart disease. The health professional enters the input values from the patient's health report. The data is fed into the model which predicts the probability of having heart disease. 
The main objective of this research is to develop a heart prediction system. The system can discover and extract hidden knowledge associated with diseases from a historical heart data set Heart disease prediction system aims to exploit data mining techniques on medical data sets to assist in the prediction of heart diseases. 
Specific Objectives: 
• Provides a new approach to concealed patterns in the data. 
• Helps avoid human biases. 
• To implement a StackingCVClassifier that classifies the disease as per the input of the user. 
• Reduce the cost of medical tests. 

We have used five machine-learning algorithms in our project:
1. Logistic regression
2. KNN
3. Ensemble learning
4. SVM
5. Extreme Gradient

And combined the best three performing models using Ensemble Learning techniques in order to achieve more accuracy.

CONCLUSION

The proposed system is GUI-based, user-friendly, scalable, reliable, and an expandable system.
The proposed working model can also help in reducing treatment costs by providing Initial diagnostics in time.
The model can also serve the purpose of a training tool for medical students and will be a soft diagnostic tool available for physician and cardiologist.
General physicians can utilize this tool for the initial diagnosis of cardio-patients.
There are many possible improvements that could be explored to improve the scalability and accuracy of this prediction system.
As we have developed a generalized system, in the future we can use this system for the analysis of different data sets. The performance of the health’s diagnosis can be improved significantly by handling numerous class labels in the prediction process, and it can be another positive direction of research.
In the DM warehouse, generally, the dimensionality of the heart database is high, so identification and selection of significant attributes for better diagnosis of heart disease are very challenging tasks for future research.
According to the research paper published on Hindawi SVM gave an accuracy of 80.32% followed by Logistic regression (80.32%) and XGBoost(73.77%).
In our case accuracy of SVM (98.04%) was the highest followed by XGBoost(91.70%), K-Neighbor(87.80%), and logistic regression(86.34%).
Detailed analysis shows that “chest pain” and “exercise-induced angina” was the leading cause of heart failure.
The Ensembled model which is the combination of SVM, KNN, and XGBoost also gave the equivalent accuracy as that of SVM. (i.e. 98.04%).
Hence, SVM and the Ensembled model are the best for heart disease prediction.
